# Standard Method to Multiply Two Matrices

This is my own method of multiplying two matrices. It must follow the rules for matrix multiplication where the number of columns in matrix1 = number of rows in matrix2. This might be a slighly less efficient method of doing matrix multiplication because it essentially runs through 4 for loops (`O(n)`).

GeeksforGeeks has an alternative solution to multiply two matrices which is more efficient, running in $O(n^3)$
