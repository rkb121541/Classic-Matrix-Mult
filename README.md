# Standard Method to Multiply Two Matrices

This is my own method of multiplying two matrices. When running the program, it must follow the rules for matrix multiplication where the number of columns in matrix1 = number of rows in matrix2. This is a slightly less efficient method of doing matrix multiplication because it essentially runs through 4 for loops resulting in a runtime of $O(n^4)$.

GeeksforGeeks has an alternative solution to multiply two matrices which is more efficient, running in $O(n^3)$
