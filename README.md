# Standard Method to Multiply Two Matrices

This is my own code for multiplying two matrices. When running the program, it must follow the rules for matrix multiplication where the number of columns in matrix1 = number of rows in matrix2. This is not the most efficient way of doing matrix multiplication because it runs through 4 for-loops resulting in a runtime of $O(n^4)$. [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-program-multiply-two-matrices/) has an alternative solution to multiply two matrices which is more efficient, running in $O(n^3)$.
